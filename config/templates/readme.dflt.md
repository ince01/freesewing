## About FreeSewing 💀

Where the world of makers and developers collide, that's where you'll find FreeSewing.

Our [core library](https://freesewing.dev/reference/api/) is a *batteries-included* toolbox
for parametric design of sewing patterns. It's a modular system (check our list
of [plugins](https://freesewing.dev/reference/plugins/) and getting started is as simple as:

```bash
npm init freesewing-pattern
```

The [getting started](https://freesewing.dev/guides/getting-started/) section on [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/) is a good
entrypoint to our documentation, but you'll find a lot more there, including
our [API reference](https://freesewing.dev/reference/api/),
as well as [our turorial](https://freesewing.dev/tutorials/pattern-design/),
and [howtos](https://freesewing.dev/howtos/).

If you're a maker, checkout [freesewing.org](https://freesewing/) where you can generate
our sewing patterns adapted to your measurements.
